This directory contains doxygen output.  No files should be committed here (other than this README.txt).  The automatically generated html and latex directories are being ignored.

You must have doxygen installed to generate the dev documentation.  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Reminder:  doxygen does not do a live update of the docs as you code.  In other words, if you make changes and want to see the rendering, you must run doxygen again.
