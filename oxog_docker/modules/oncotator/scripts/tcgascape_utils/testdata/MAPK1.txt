Deletion Summary:	MAPK1 is not significantly focally deleted across the entire dataset of 1955 tumors and is not located within a focal peak region of deletion.  MAPK1 is significantly focally deleted in 6 of 15 independent subtypes analyzed in our dataset. It is not within the focal peak region of deletion in any of the individual tumor types. For reference, 3.583% of all genes are significantly focally deleted in at least 6 subtypes and 100.000% of all genes are present in focal deletion peaks in at least 0 subtypes.
